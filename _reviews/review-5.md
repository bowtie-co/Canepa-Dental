We moved to Washington about 2 years ago. My mom and my two younger siblings all use Dr. Canepa and LOVE him and Carrie, so I naturally chose him for my husband and I. We love the Canepa family! Doctor is a perfectionist and very honest with his dental work. Carrie is a fantastic hygienist, who is just a kick to chit chat with! Jamie, at the desk, is also the backbone that keeps everything working smoothly with appointments, insurance questions and is completely understandable and flexible! Would recommend Canepa Dental in a heartbeat!!
